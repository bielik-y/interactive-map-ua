# React app (Google Map + Clustering)

## Description

Frontend focused project for people in need which provides map with humanitarian aid centers. I've been working hard to provide the best client experience observing points on Google Map: I added custom point markers, clustering for group of markers, hover animations etc. I encountered some bugs in @react-google-maps/api library but interactive map still works good with it. But ofc here is room for improvement.

**Main used technologies:**
- **React 18** (Plain react)
- **TypeScript**
- **Google Maps API** (Map components & geocoding)
- **SCSS modules** (Styling)

## Key Features

- Animated Landing page
- Integrated Google Map view
- Custom map markers 
- Clustering for group of markers on different zoom level
- List of centers of help
- Fully responsive UI
- Error handling on client

## Setting up 

1. Step 1: Install all dependencies `npm i`
2. Step 2: Define Google Map API Key in `public/.env` file.
3. Start the app `npm start`
